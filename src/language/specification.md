# Variables

## Declaring a variable
A variable can be declared with the symbol ` = `.
The variable name can be a set of multiple words. Numbers shouldn't be part of a variable name.

Example:
`My weekend expenses = $123`
`My week expenses = $456`
`Total is My weekend expenses + My week expenses`

## Changing variables' values
A variable can be redefined by simply giving it a new value. The most recently defined value will be used on subsequent lines.

`My weekend expenses = $123`
`My weekend expenses = $456`
